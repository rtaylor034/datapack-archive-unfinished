Archive Description
=====
This repository is an archive for datapacks that are unfinished and are no longer being worked on.

Pack discontinuation is usually due Minecraft update or knowledge that I gain rendering the methods used in the pack (or the pack itself) obsolete/broken.

The descriptions in this archive will be in a subjective format compared to [the finished datapack archive](https://github.com/rtaylor034/datapack-archive-finished); Not I nor anyone else will find use in a comprehensive objective description of unfinished/broken packs, and these descriptions are mainly for myself.

## GConstruct v1
**namespace: 'gconstruct'**
**years in progress: 2021-2022**
#### Vision
A general overhaul to some of the aspects of survival minecraft that I found annoying or otherwise needing improvement with a focus on automation.
#### Current State
The following blocks:
- Constuctor
  - Made by dropping a piston ontop of a crafting table
  - Used to craft everything GConstruct.
- Teleporter
  - Has a single slot for an item stack.
  - When a player crouches on a teleporter with an item stack in it, they are teleported to the nearest teleporter that contained the exact same item stack.
- Sies Device
  - Can store an infinite amount of a single item.
- Item Filter
  - Has a single slot for an item.
  - Moves all items above the filter that match the given item to below the filter (like a downward facing dispenser)
  - Works on both item entities as well as items inside container blocks directly above the filter.

A raytracing system to 'place' the custom blocks (custom blocks were retextured carrot_on_a_stick's).

A system that allowed me to easily add more constructor recipes.

The non-functional dummy block implementations for an Augment Table and a Block Placer.

#### Reflection
