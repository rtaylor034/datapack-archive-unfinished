 ==== INPUT OUTPUT FUNCTIONS (Methods) ====
 - a method is defined by a folder that has a "run.mcfunction" file inside of it. the method is named by the folder containing the "run.mcfunction" file.
 - any other mcfunction files inside of a method folder are helper functions, and are not to be called by any function outside of the method folder.

 == Method Comment Notation ==
 - every methods "run" function includes comment lines specifying the:
 {
 PARAMS <Parameters [data]>
 OUT <Output(s) [data]>
 USE <Description of use>
 CONTEXT <Where this function is meant to be run from>
 NOTE <Other important information about the method>
 }
 - some methods may have "ALT" or "OPT" PARAMS.
 - ALT means that you may specify the regular PARAMS |OR| the ALT PARAMS. *not both*
 - OPT means that the PARAMS are optional, and are denoted by lowercase letters instead of uppercase.


 = Data Notation =
 Scoreboards - (<target> -> <objective>) | Commons - "slime_param", "slime_out", "slime_var"
 Storage NBT - [<path> -> <storage>] | Commons - "slime:param", "slime:out", "slime:var" | Path - <MethodName>.<variable>
 Entity NBT - {<path> -> <entity>}


==== NAMING / FORMAT CONVENTIONS ====

= Tags =
- all tags should have their datapack id name at the beginning of the tag name, followed by the general name of the tag.
- spaces in tags are denoted by a "-".
- tags that only exist within 1 tick, should start with a "_".
~ EX: marker entity that marks a block is spawned with the tag "mypack-coolblock". when the block is broken, the marker is given the tag "_mypack-destroyed" for a subtick before being killed.

= Data Storage =
- Datapacks should have up to 5 data storage namespaces, as follows:
"<namespace>:param" - EXCLUSIVELY for specifying parameters for in/out methods. (subtick)
"<namespace>:var" - EXCLUSIVELY for storing subtick variables that require NBT. (subtick)
"<namespace>:out" - EXCLUSIVELY for storing the output of in/out methods. (subtick [unmanaged])
"<namespace>:storage" - For all lasting data that a datapack stores. (lasting)

- Datapacks MUST have the following data entries under "<namespace>:packdata" when loaded:
"name" - The display name of the datapack (ex: "SlimeCore").
"namespace" - The namespace of the datapack (ex: "slime").

"activeDependents" - This stores an array of datapacks that depend on this datapack (their packdata). This should not be specified when loaded, only updated by a datapacks "<namespace>:global/dependupon"

(TODO : UNFINISHED)
