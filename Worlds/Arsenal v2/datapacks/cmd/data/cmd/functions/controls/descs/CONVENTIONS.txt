short descriptions should have a soft-character cap of 32

BETTER WAY PROPOSAL
- create a c# program that takes a description and seperates it into a word array (ex: ["the","dog","is","epic"]).
- on reload, parse that array using a universal parse method. this parse method would highlight keywords and generate ratios based off certain character-word combinations.
- this would probably remove the need for 2 descriptions
